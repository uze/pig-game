# Pig Game [https://uzeio.github.io/pig-game/]

This was my first attempt to make a javascript web app.

Rules:
- First one to 50 points wins
- Player may roll the dice as many times as he/she would like.
- Each results will be added to the current score box
- BUT, if the player rolles a 1 all of the points in the score box will be set to 0 and it will be the next players turn.
- If the player chooses 'Hold' the current score in the score box will be added to the players total. After that, it's the next player's turn.
